Tell Me a User Story
================
This project was born out of office banter right before an extended weekend. Normally, when crazy ideas are generated in the office, we record them in a doc to keep track of them. I still think Alaskan Mosquito Fighting could go far, but I'm not in Alaska nor the mosquito fighting rings. At least not anymore. Not after what happened to Johnny Two-Pints....

ANYWAYS

This first release is very limited in functionality and scope. There is no database and the stories are generated from static strings. 

In future releases (read: bored weekends) I will add database functionality with a layer of NODE.js. This will allow for the ability to create new mad-lib type stories from forms directly in the application. 

Until then, I hope you enjoy this simple little app, and if you don't that's OK. Here's a smile to brighten your day. :)
